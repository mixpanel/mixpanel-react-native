## [v2.2.1](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/tree/v2.2.1) (2023-03-23)

### Enhancements

- bump iOS version to 4.1.0 [\#180](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/pull/180)

## [v2.2.0](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/tree/v2.2.0) (2023-03-06)

### NOTE:
- From this version we will prefix randomly generated device-specific distinct_ids with "$device:". The prefix is applied the next time a new random ID is generated, any IDs generated by previous SDK versions and  persisted on the device will continue to be used as-is until reset is called to generate a new ID. This does not change the value sent for the $device_id property, which will continue to be the randomly-generated ID without a prefix. Mixpanel's $identify endpoint has been updated to accept UUIDs with this prefix to coordinate with this change.


### Enhancements

- bump ios to 4.0.5 and android to 7.3.0 [\#176](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/pull/176)

#

## [v2.0.0](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/tree/v2.0.0) (2022-09-09)

### BREAKING CHANGE: 
This major release removes all remaining calls to Mixpanel's `/decide` API endpoint. The main effect of this is that the SDK no longer fetches the remote status of your [project's "Automatically collect common mobile events" setting](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004596186#enable-or-disable-common-mobile-events). From this version forward, automatic event tracking can only be controlled by the, now required, parameter `trackAutomaticEvents`. Upon upgrading, existing implementations will need to add this parameter to their Mixpanel initializer calls.

### Enhancements

- make trackAutomaticEvents required and bump versions to deprecate Decide [\#153](https://github.com/mixpanel/mixpanel-react-native/pull/153)
